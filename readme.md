# Building Web Scrapers in Python for Beginners - Community Edition!

Welcome! If you're reading this, it's because you've found the community edition of my upcoming book ["Building Web Scrapers in Python for Beginners."](https://leanpub.com/beginner-python-web-scraping)

The version you're seeing here is the community edition, meaning it's free, unfinished and unpolished. I'm going to infrequently update this version with new wordings and a couple of illustrations, but for the most part, what you see is what you get.

This is meant to be a teaser for the full book I'm writing on LeanPub that [you can find here](https://leanpub.com/beginner-python-web-scraping), which is currently priced at $7.99 while it's a work in progress. Over time, as I update that book and add more content, the price will increase as well, but this version will always be free. If you're interested, I recommend buying it early! The price will only go up as I add more content and get closer to the full launch date.

Thank you for your support, and I hope you enjoy!
